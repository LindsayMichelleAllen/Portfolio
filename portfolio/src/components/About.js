                I am expected to graduate with a BS in Computer Science from Washington State University in December of 2020. I initially began my degree path in Neuroscience, but an intro
                to programming class was all I needed to see this was my true passion. I've had the opportunity to intern in the Research & Development department at Schweitzer Engineering 
                Laboratories where I was exposed to all different types of programming from microcontrollers to web development. On my free time I play guitar, ride motorcycles, and hang 
                out with the coolest pup in the world.
                Maybe talk about research with Crandall?
